<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hip Arthroscopy Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pincer Type</li><li>Cam Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The hip arthroscopy market features two primary types of femoroacetabular impingement: pincer type and cam type. Pincer type impingement involves overgrowth of the acetabular rim, leading to excessive coverage of the femoral head, which can cause joint pain and restricted movement. In contrast, cam type impingement occurs when the femoral head is irregularly shaped, resulting in impaired joint function. Both conditions necessitate specialized arthroscopic interventions for diagnosis and treatment, driving market growth and development in surgical technologies.</p></p>
