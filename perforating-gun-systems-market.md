<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Perforating Gun Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>WCP</li><li>TCP</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Perforating gun systems in the oil and gas industry are primarily categorized into two types: Wireline Conveyed Perforating (WCP) and Tubing Conveyed Perforating (TCP). WCP involves deploying perforating guns via wireline cables, allowing precise placement in wellbores. This method is often used in open-hole or cased-hole environments. Conversely, TCP utilizes the production tubing to convey the perforating guns, enabling higher pressures and optimizing the perforation process for high-rate production wells. Both systems enhance reservoir access and efficiency.</p></p>
